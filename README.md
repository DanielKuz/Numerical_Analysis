# Numerical_Analysis
Final project for the Numerical Analysis course (382.1.2705) led by Dr. Puzis Rami- Ben-Gurion University of the Negev

In this Project we implemented numerical analysis methods learned in class
1 - Interpolation using Bezier curves ( Natural splines)
2 - Finding intersections between functions using Newton-Raphson method for discovering roots
3 - Calculating area between functions using intersections found in assignment 2 and Simpson method for area calculation
4 - LeastSquares fitting
5 - Shape fitting from noisy data and calculating area
